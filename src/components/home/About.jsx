                    Pursuing graduation with a degree in BCA, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned MERN - STACK web development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, ExpressJs, MongoDB and Data Structures & Algorithms. I am also familiar with C++, JavaScritp and Java. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.
